# Note: This is a pseudo-code that does not really run on the server. 
# It should run on the server on a daily basis and sync the raw_data folder with the latest version of datasets everyday.
# We can use crontab to set up a daily cron job to run it.
# But since the requirement of project2 does not ask students to really ingest live data everyday, so this does not really run.
